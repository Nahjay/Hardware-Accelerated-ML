# Image Identification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a robust image recognition system using TensorFlow and Keras, focusing on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for precise image classification. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showcasing expertise in Python-based deep learning.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate image classification.
  - Trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Web Interface:**
  - Developed an intuitive local web interface with the Flask web framework.
  - Combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless user interaction.
  - Allows users to upload images for classification based on the trained model's evaluation.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the Flask web application:

    ```bash
    python src/app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the image classification web interface.

## Fine-Tuning

The model and training parameters have been iteratively fine-tuned to enhance accuracy. Feel free to experiment with different architectures or datasets to further optimize the model.
