              The model is trained to predict based of off 10 different
              classifications of images found in the CIFAR-10 dataset. These
              classes are as follows: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer,
              dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. If you upload an image that is
              not one of these classes, the model will not be able to predict
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model is not perfect and will not always be able to predict
              the image correctly. If you upload an image that is not one of the
              classes listed above, the model will still try to predict it. The
              model will most likely predict the image to be one of the classes
              listed above, but it will not be correct.
            </p>
